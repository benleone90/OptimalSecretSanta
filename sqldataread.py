###Needs to be integrated with emailing code in a for loop

#second column: first_name
#third_column: last_name
#fourth column: email

print("Total rows are: ", len(records))

for row in records:
    group_names.append(row[0]) #assuming group name is first column

print(first_names[0], last_names[0], emails[0])

#run email bot in a loop below here using the arrays
